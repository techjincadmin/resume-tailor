  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: February 17, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>Resume Tailor ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps users tailor their resumes to job descriptions using AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>The Extension may collect and process the following types of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resume content:</strong> Text and files you upload or paste into the Extension for tailoring purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Job descriptions:</strong> Text extracted from job listing pages you visit (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.) when you choose to use the Extension.</li>
    <li><strong>API keys:</strong> If you provide your own AI API key (e.g., Anthropic Claude), it is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's <code>storage</code> API and is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Extension settings and preferences:</strong> Stored locally in your browser.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Resume content and job descriptions are sent to a third-party AI provider (Anthropic) solely to generate tailored resume suggestions. This transmission occurs only when you explicitly initiate a tailoring action.</li>
    <li>We do not store, log, or retain your resume or job description data on any server we operate.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, share, or monetize your data in any way.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Extension uses the <strong>Anthropic Claude API</strong> to process resume and job description text. Your data is subject to <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a> when sent to their service. Please review their policy to understand how they handle your data.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All user preferences, settings, and API keys are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in <code>chrome.storage</code> API. This data never leaves your device except as described above (API calls to Anthropic).</p>

  <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension requests the following Chrome permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your settings and preferences locally.</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To read the content of the current job listing page when you activate the Extension.</li>
    <li><strong>scripting:</strong> To extract job description text from supported job sites.</li>
    <li><strong>sidePanel:</strong> To display the Resume Tailor interface in Chrome's side panel.</li>
    <li><strong>host_permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;):</strong> To support job description extraction across all job listing websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This Extension is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected with an updated date at the top of this page.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>admin@techjinc.com</strong></p>
